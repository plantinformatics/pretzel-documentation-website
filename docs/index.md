## Funding
Pretzel is currently (2022-) funded as part of the Australian Grains Genebank Strategic Partnership, a $30M joint investment between the Victorian State Government and Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) that aims to unlock the genetic potential of plant genetic resources for the benefit of the Australian grain growers.
