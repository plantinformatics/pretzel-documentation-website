# VCF Genotype Search

In this Use Case, a summary of genotypes for AGG Plant Genetic Resources can be simply and rapidly visualised. For example, a user may wish to view the genotypes for a set of accessions of interest at a small subset of trait linked markers, to make a decision on which accessions to use in an experiment. In this example we will use Pretzel to display a summary of a set of AGG barley Plant Genetic Resources at two markers
AVRIG00246  and AVRIG00484.

## Loading a VCF and selecting samples 
Click on the Search tab in the left navigation panel.
![vcf-feature-search-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9d3d9ca-b503-4f4f-83de-040ee4c16476)
While in the search tab, find the VCF Genotype Search box. 
Within the box, select your VCF to search.
![vcf-feature-search-02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2028eec5-6a25-4120-882b-1806266943c1)
This will load the VCF and give you a list of all the available samples.
If one is clicked it will automatically be added into selected samples input box.

### (Optional) Loading multiple samples 
!!! note

    The following search has only been tested up to 1000 samples. The interface will become extremely slow if a larger number of samples are selected. If it does become slow efresh the page to restart.
To select a range of samples, hold down the CRTL key and select another sample in the list.

## Adding features to be searched
Within the Features input text box, paste your feature IDs.
The one used in this example is:
``` text title="Feature names"
AVRIG00246
AVRIG00484
```
![vcf-feature-search-05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a914dd99-83eb-421e-b5cf-c6a17d36abb9)
## End output
