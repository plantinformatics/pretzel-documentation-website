## Searching Genolink

Genolink provides three main ways to search:

- **Passport Data Filter** – refine search by passport descriptors (date of collection, crop, taxonomy, institute, country of origin, biological status, storage type).

- **Accession Number Filter** – enter one or multiple accession numbers directly.

- **GenotypeID Filter** – search by Genotype IDs linked to accessions.

These options can be combined to refine searches and ensure only relevant accessions are retrieved.

## Applying Genesys-PGR filters
How to open filters, pick taxon, geography, traits, etc., and apply/clear.

## Wild text search
What it matches, examples, tips.

## Accession number search
Accepted formats, multiple entries, common pitfalls.

## GenotypeID search
Where to find IDs, batch search, expected results.

## Filtering for genotyped accessions
Toggle/checkbox, what “genotyped only” means across APIs.

## Requesting genotype data
Request flow, where requests go, expected turnaround.

## Genotype data based on genomic region
Specify reference, chromosome, start–end; validation rules.

## Genotype data based on names of markers
Accepted markers list, partial names, case sensitivity.

## All markers
What this mode returns, performance considerations.

## Exporting as a VCF
Subset options (samples, markers, region), header info, download.
