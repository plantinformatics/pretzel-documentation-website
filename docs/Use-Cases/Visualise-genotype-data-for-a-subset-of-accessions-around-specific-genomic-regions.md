# Visualise genotype data for a subset of accessions around specific genomic regions

!!! note

    This use case assumes that a genomic region of interest has already been identified. This can be done from either of the following use cases:

    - [Visualise the location of a subset of markers​ or a region](/Use-Cases/Visualise-the-location-of-a-subset-of-markers/)
    - [Finding a marker or gene on a genome](/Use-Cases/Finding-a-marker-or-gene-on-a-genome/)
    
    This specific example continues on from [Visualise the location of a subset of markers​ or a region](/Use-Cases/Visualise-the-location-of-a-subset-of-markers/)

Click back onto the Explore tab and search for a genotype dataset and add it to the view then in the view, click on the axis title. This dataset can be found on [agg.plantinformatics.io](https://agg.plantinformatics.io/)

Click and drag over the area of interest along the axis to select a region on the chromosome and click the zoom button below the axis

In the resulting box that pops up, click desired samples (ctrl click to select multiple samples), the click "VCF lookup" button at the bottom of the pop up window. The selected samples will display in the bottom text box
