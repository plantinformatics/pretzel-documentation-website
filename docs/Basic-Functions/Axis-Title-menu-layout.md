## Split Axis
To view multiple data sets simultaneously, such as different marker types or genes aligned against the same genome or chromosome, the split axis feature is very useful. To enable it, click on the axis menu layout, select the downward-slanting arrow, and close the menu by clicking the cross in the top right corner.

Split axis could be done either before or after adding datasets to the axis.

### Zooming the axis

Upon zooming in the axis (Click and drag) the representation of individual features transitions from a histogram to a more distinct fingerprint view.

### Viewing the features 

=== "Adding Feature"

    Selecting an individual fingerprint band allows the user to view the feature's location, represented by an arrow, and selecting the arrow displays the feature name.

=== "Hiding Feature"
    
    Clicking the feature arrow hides the feature name, and selecting the fingerprint band again hides the feature entirely.

!!!note
    Deselect any displayed feature to ensure it is not automatically displayed the next time the same dataset is opened.

## Flip Axis

To flip or invert the axis, open the Axis Title menu and select the icon with up and down pointing arrows. See the image below for a visual representation.

## Requested features vs total features of a dataset

!!!note
    This is an advanced feature used to debug technical issues with Pretzel. It is a technical counter that tracks the number of features requested from the backend.
