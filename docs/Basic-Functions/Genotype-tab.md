# Genotype tab

The main purpose of the genotype tab is to display a genotype matrix for a set of accessions and markers. To ... (Gabriel input)

The genotype matrix requires two inputs, the features and accessions which can be inputted a number of ways. 

## Inputting features and accessions
!!!note

    The search function on the Genotype tab is only available once a VCF dataset has been loaded. 
    VCF Genotype datasets can be added using the search function in the explore tab. For more information see [Searching for a dataset](/Basic-Functions/Explore-tab/#searching-for-a-dataset)

Features can be selected via the view by selecting a region of the axies.

If the exact feature names are known, it can be inputted using the [VCF Genotype Search function](/Basic-Functions/Search-tab/#vcf-genotype-search)

| 0       | Reference    | Blue       |
| 1       | Heterozygous | Light-blue |
| 2       | Alternate    | Orange     |
